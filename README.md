# Website number 1

Welcome! This is a brief overview of this very small site.

## Technologies used:

1. Github to store the repository
2. Gitpod to write code and design
3. HTML and CSS

## Description:

The purpose of this website was to get familiar with the basics of Github and Gitpod. It is mainly a learning exercise and has helped me understand the most important and basic principles of the technologies listed above.

The site will likely stay as-is now, it's time to move on to a new and more ambitious project.
